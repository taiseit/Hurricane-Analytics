| Column name  | Units | Column description  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Serial_Num | YYYYJJJHTTNNN |  YYYY is the corresponding year of the first recorded observation of the storm; JJJ is the day of year of the first recorded observation of the storm; H is the hemisphere of the storm: N=Northern, S=Southern; TT is the absolute value of the rounded latitude of the first recorded observation of the storm (range 0-90, if basin=SA or SH, then TT in reality is negative); NNN is the rounded longitude of the first recorded observation of the storm (range 0-359) |   
|  Season | Year (UTC) |  Year |   
| Num |   | Storm number  |   
| Basin |   | Basin boundaries are generally on longitude boundaries. Southern Hemisphere basins (latitude < 0°): SI = South Indian (10° < Longitude < 135°); SP = South Pacific	(135° < Longitude < 290°); SA =	South Atlantic (-70° < Longitude < 10°). Northern Hemisphere basins (latitude > 0). Two basins are defined solely by longitude: NI = 	North Indian (30° < Longitude < 100°); WP =	Western Pacific (100° < Longitude < 180°) |
| Sub_basin |   | Southern Hemisphere subbasins: WA (SI)	Western Australia	(In SI and Longitude > 90°); EA (SP)	Eastern Australia	(In SP and Longitude < 160°). Northern Hemisphere subbasins: AS (NI)	Arabian Sea	(In NI and Longitude < 78°); BB (NI)	Bay of Bengal	(In NI and Longitude > 78°); CP (EP)	Central Pacific	(In EP and Longitude < -140°)| 
| Name |   |  Name of storm |   
| ISO_time |	YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | Time stored using ISO standard format |   
| Nature |   | Cyclone Nature based on reports from source centers: ET = extratropical; TS = Tropical in nature; SS = sub tropical storm; MX = Conflicting reports from centers; NR = Not Reported |   
| Latitude |	degrees_north | Degrees north |   
| Longitude | degrees_east | Degrees east |   
| Wind(WMO) | kt  | Wind speed in knots |   
| Pres(WMO) | mb  | Minimum Central Pressure in mb  |
